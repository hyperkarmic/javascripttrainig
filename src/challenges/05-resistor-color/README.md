# Resistor Color

## Challenge

Resistors have color coded bands, where each color maps to a number. The first 2 bands of a resistor have a simple encoding scheme: each color maps to a single number. These colors are encoded as follows:

- Black: 0
- Brown: 1
- Red: 2
- Orange: 3
- Yellow: 4
- Green: 5
- Blue: 6
- Violet: 7
- Grey: 8
- White: 9

Write a function which returns the corresponding value of a resistor color. If the color does not match any of the above colors return 'Invalid Resistor Color'.

### Note

- Write your tests in the file `index.spec.js` located inside the `__tests__` directory.
- Add the function in file `index.js`.
- Follow a Test Driven Development (TDD) approach.
