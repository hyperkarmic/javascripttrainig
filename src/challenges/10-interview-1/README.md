# Interview 1 Challenge

## Challenge

You are given an ordered list of positive integers and from the list of integers you have to find a pair of numbers whose sum is equal to a desired sum.

For example, if the list of numbers is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` find a pair of integers that add up to 7. You could also end up with multiple pairs and maybe extend the challenge to return all pairs that add up to the desired number. 

*Note* - Return the pair as an array of two integers. If there are multiple pairs then return an array of pairs.
